# Placeholder for extension icon
#
# To create a proper icon:
# 1. Create a 128x128 PNG image
# 2. Use a relevant icon (folder with tools, context menu symbol, etc.)
# 3. Ensure it looks good on both light and dark backgrounds
# 4. Save as icon.png and replace this file
#
# You can use tools like:
# - Figma
# - Adobe Illustrator
# - Canva
# - Icon generators online
#
# For now, this is a text placeholder.
